# Recursion Worksheet: The Factorial Example

This repository is a simple worksheet that walks you through the **three-step formula for recursion** using factorials as the example.

---

## The Three-Step Formula for Recursion
1. **Base Case** – the simplest possible input where the function can return directly.  
2. **Recursive Case** – define the problem in terms of a smaller version of itself.  
3. **Combine** – use the results of the recursive call to build the final answer.

## Why Factorial?
Factorials provide a clear, easy-to-follow example of recursion.  
- The base case is **1! = 1**  
- The recursive case is **n! = n × (n-1)!**  

By working through factorials step by step, you’ll see how recursion naturally reduces a big problem into smaller and smaller ones until it reaches the base case.

## Purpose
The goal of this worksheet is not just to compute factorials, but to help you **master the recursion pattern** so you can apply it to any recursive function in the future.
